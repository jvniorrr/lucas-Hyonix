 Discord bot for Lucas, handle orders and give users access to their personal servers.

Discord bot allowed users to interact with the servers provided by Lucas a friend of mine who I wanted to develop a project for. Wanted to gain experience with Python and scriptiong so decided a discord bot to automate his processes and allowing users to mess with their deployed servers. ARCHIVED NOW.
